# Wildland Fires and their effect on US National Park visitation

## Motivation

Forest fires (periodic burns) are an important natural process in a variety of forests and are beneficial to the ecosystem. Fire Suppression over an extended period is unhealthy for the forest and harmful to humans. Warmer and drier climates due to climate change have made wildfires larger and difficult to control causing extended damage to both forests and human settlements.
